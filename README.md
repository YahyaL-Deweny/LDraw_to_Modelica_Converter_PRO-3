 to be used as a LeoCAD Plug-in for Simulation Purposes.
 
The code takes an LDR file as an input to produce a modelica code as an output (cutomized only for gears for gears)
  - The name of the LDR file is changeable and must match the name of the actual file.
  - Also the Dictionary that contains the information about gears, has to cover and to be filled with all the gears that exist in the LDR file first.
